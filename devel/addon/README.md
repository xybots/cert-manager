# End-to-end test addons

This directory contains code for deploying instances of addons used during
end-to-end tests and whilst developing.

This includes things like [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/),
[ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx) and
[Pebble](https://github.com/letsencrypt/pebble) amongst others.

These tools are designed to be easily reusable during tests or by developers
when testing out new features or writing tests.
